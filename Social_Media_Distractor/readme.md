# Social Media Distractor

- About the application

    This is a simple automation application that helps you to stay productive during workdays and keeps you away from unwanted social media apps, I only integrated Instagram for now.

- More about application

    The concept is that the code will change your Instagram password on Monday and mail you your password on Friday. by doing this you can't log in to your Instagram on workdays as you don't have any idea what your Instagram password is, yes you can click on forget password and generate a new password, but that's long progress and many people will avoid doing that.

    The password that will be generated will be highly secured.

    I haven't uploaded it on the server as it's a beta version and for testing purposes only.
